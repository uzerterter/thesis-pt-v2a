Extract Memory Locations from Pro Tools Session

This script reads all memory locations from the currently open Pro Tools session
and outputs them in a Python-friendly format for hardcoding into auto_spotting_wizard.py.

Usage:
    1. Open your test session in Pro Tools
    2. Create memory locations at desired positions (markers for audio events)
    3. Run this script: python extract_memory_locations.py
    4. Copy the output and paste into auto_spotting_wizard.py MEMORY_LOCATIONS list
    5. Delete the memory locations from the session (they will be recreated by the wizard)

Requirements:
    - Pro Tools running with session open
    - py-ptsl installed (pip install py-ptsl)
    - PTSL server running in Pro Tools
