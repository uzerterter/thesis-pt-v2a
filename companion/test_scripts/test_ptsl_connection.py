PTSL Connection Test Script
============================

This script performs a basic TCP connection test to verify that the Pro Tools Scripting Library
(PTSL) server is running and accessible on the local machine.

PTSL Background:
- PTSL is Pro Tools' built-in automation server for remote control and scripting
- It runs as a gRPC service on localhost:31416 (default port)
- Must be explicitly enabled in Pro Tools preferences (Setup > Preferences > MIDI)
- Allows external applications to control Pro Tools (import audio, create tracks, etc.)

Purpose:
This is a lightweight connectivity check that doesn't require the full gRPC/Protobuf setup.
It simply verifies that:
1. Pro Tools is running
2. PTSL is enabled in preferences
3. The PTSL server port (31416) is accessible
4. No firewall is blocking the connection

Usage:
    python test_ptsl_connection.py              # Test localhost:31416
    python test_ptsl_connection.py --port 9001  # Test custom port
    
Exit Codes:
    0 - Success: PTSL server is accessible
    1 - Failure: Cannot connect to PTSL server

    Test if Pro Tools PTSL server is accessible via TCP connection.
    
    This performs a simple socket connection test without sending any data.
    It's equivalent to checking if a web server is running before making HTTP requests.
    
    How it works:
    1. Creates a TCP socket
    2. Attempts to connect to the PTSL server port
    3. Closes the connection immediately
    4. Returns success/failure based on connection result
    
    Args:
        host (str): PTSL server hostname or IP address (default: 'localhost')
                   For local Pro Tools instances, this should always be 'localhost'
        port (int): PTSL server TCP port (default: 31416)
                   Pro Tools PTSL uses port 31416 by default (not configurable)
        timeout (float): Connection timeout in seconds (default: 2)
                        How long to wait before giving up on the connection
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if PTSL server accepts connections, False otherwise
        
    Example:
        >>> test_ptsl_connection()
        Testing PTSL connection to localhost:31416...
        ✅ PTSL server is running on localhost:31416

    PTSL must be manually enabled in Pro Tools preferences as a security measure.

    PTSL Setup Requirements:
    - Pro Tools 2019.5 or later (PTSL introduced in 2019.5)
    - A Pro Tools session must be open (PTSL only runs when session is active)
    - PTSL preference must be enabled (disabled by default)
    - Port 31416 must not be blocked by firewall
    
    Common Issues:
    - Firewall blocking: Windows Defender or antivirus may block Pro Tools network access
    - PTSL not enabled: Easy to miss the checkbox in MIDI preferences
    - No session open: PTSL server only starts when a session is open
    - Port conflict: Another application using port 31416 (rare)
